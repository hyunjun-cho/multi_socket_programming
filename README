This code has been tested (though not extensively) on Linux,
SunOS, and Mac OS (Darwin).  I did the primary development and
testing on my MacBook.

Makefile
configure    - configuration script; needs to be executed again when you change operating systems 
               generates files Config and config.h
echosrv.c    - echo server (the program you will work on)
echocli.c    - client test program
echolib.h    - header for echolib.c
echolib.c    - shared code, used by echocli.c and echosrv.c
submitP4.sh  - script to submit program
usleep.c     - usleep implementation used by testone, since SunOS doesn't provide it

not necessary, but may be provided later:

testone      - a script to execute driver
driver.c     - a test driver for multisrv (sends multiple concurrent streams)
timer.c      - a test harness for multisrv (checks resource usage)

results.sample  contains log files from executing "./testone 2" and "./testone 4" on SunOS, Linux, and Darwin
